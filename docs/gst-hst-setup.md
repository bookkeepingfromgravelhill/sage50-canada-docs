# GST/HST Setup Notes (Canada)

- Create separate **tax codes** for each province you operate in (e.g., `HST-NS 15%`, `GST-5%`, `PST-BC 7%`).
- Mark items/services **taxable** or **exempt** appropriately; avoid mixing rates in one code.
- Use CRAâ€™s current guidance for *Quick Method* eligibility and rates.
- Reconcile tax collected vs. remitted each filing period; store working papers with return confirmations.
